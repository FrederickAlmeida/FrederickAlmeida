# Hello! Welcome to my GitHub profile.
## My name is Frederick!

I'm a Computer Science Undergraduate at Cin-UFPE. I'm interested and studying Machine learning and Deep Learning, the area I've always been fascinated about, even before starting my graduation. I love solving mathematical and programming problems, and learning new technologies!
